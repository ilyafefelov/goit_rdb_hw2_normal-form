### Database Normalization (0NF â†’ 3NF)
##### âœ… Purpose
Practice database normalization, transforming data from an unnormalized form through 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.

##### ðŸ—ƒ Tables
- table0: Initial unnormalized data.

- table1: Normalized to 1NF (eliminated repeating groups).

- table2_orders, table2_order_items: Normalized to 2NF (separated order details and items).

- table3_clients, table3_orders, table3_products, table3_order_items: Normalized to 3NF (resolved transitive dependencies).

##### ðŸ›  Tools
MySQL Workbench for modeling, diagramming, and scripting.

##### ðŸ“Œ Result
Clearly demonstrates normalization steps, proper schema design, primary/foreign key relationships, and improved database efficiency.
